# Sway monitor configer

This script enables you to save your monitor setup to a shell script.
This also includes setting up waybar, which requires some work because I use different configs for the primary monitors and the other monitors.

Note: setting up you monitors is not done here. See for example https://github.com/artizirk/wdisplays

This is essentially a code generator for swaymsg.

See `./generate_test.py` for example output of the script.
